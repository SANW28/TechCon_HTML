TechCon 2024 Website Project

Overview
This project involves building a comprehensive website for TechCon 2024 using HTML. You'll create five core webpages, each focusing on different aspects of the conference, while applying essential HTML elements and best practices.

Project Scope
The website will include:

Homepage (index.html): Introduces TechCon 2024 and provides navigation.
About Page (about.html): Details TechCon's history, mission, and speakers.
Schedule Page (schedule.html): Presents conference events and speakers in a table format.
Register Page (register.html): Features a user-friendly registration form for attendees.
Contact Page (contact.html): Provides comprehensive contact info and a "Contact Us" form.

Concepts Covered:

HTML structure using <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer> tags.
Headings (h1-h6), paragraphs (<p>), and text formatting.
Navigation with hyperlinks (<a> tags) and interlinking pages.
Creating tables (<table>, <tr>, <td>) for organizing schedules.
Designing forms (<form>) for registration and contact purposes.
Incorporating images (<img>), videos (<video>), and interactive maps (<iframe>) using appropriate HTML tags.
This project aims to enhance my HTML skills by building a functional and informative website for TechCon 2024.
